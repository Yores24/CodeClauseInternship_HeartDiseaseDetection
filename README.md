# Overview:

Heart disease is a prevalent health condition that requires early detection for effective treatment. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease based on several medical attributes.

# Features:

Train multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Compare model performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deploy the best-performing model as a web application using Flask.
Provide a user-friendly interface for users to input medical attributes and receive predictions for heart disease.
